# Belly Button Biodiversity

In this module we created a dashboard showing the demographic information of the volunteers, and graphs to show the visualization of bacterial data for each volunteer. Once the volunteers open the dashboard, they should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly butttons. Once Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candaditate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify if that species is found in quantity in their navel.

## Goals
- Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer's navel, using javascript to select only the most populous species.
- Create a bubble chart to visualize
