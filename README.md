# Belly Button Biodiversity

In this module, Roza started a project to create dynamic charts in order to help volunteers who are intersted in selling their bacteria to Improbable Beef, determine if they have the bacteria that is suitable for synthetic beef production. She created a dashboard showing the demographic information of each of the volunteers, and graphs to show the visualization of bacterial data for each volunteer. Once the volunteers open the dashboard and enter their unique ID number, they should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species that are in their belly butttons. 

Also, once Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candaditate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify if that species is found in quantity in their navel.

## Goals
- Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer's navel, using javascript to select only the most populous species. 
- Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer's navel.
- Complete the demographic information panel to include the following for each volunteer:
  1. ID number
  2. Ethnicity
  3. Gender
  4. Age
  5. Location
  6. Bbtype
  7. Wfreq

## Results
- Result #1: When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940's data should be displayed in the dashboard. 
- Resut #2: When a new ID number is selected from the dropdown menu, all of the plots and the info panel should be udpated.
- Result #3: Customize the layout to create an attractive dashboard. 

## Final Results
